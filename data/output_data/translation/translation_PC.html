                           The island of Britain is eight hundred miles long and two hundred wide.
                           And here on this island are five languages: English and British and
                           Welsh and Scottish and Pictish and Latin [the 'book-language']. The earliest
                           inhabitants of this land were Britons, who came from western Gaul and settled
                           at first in the south of Britain. Then it happened that the Picts came
                           from the south of Scandinavia with a few ['not many'] long ships, and came at
                           first up into northern Ireland and there beseeched the Scots that they might
                           dwell there. But they would not let them, for the Scots said, "We can,
                           however, give you advice. We know another island to the east of here where
                           you can live if you wish. And if anyone should resist you, we will help you
                           so that you can conquer it." Then the Picts went and conquered this land
                           to the north; and the Britons had it to the south, as we already said. And
                           then the Picts asked for women from the Scots for themselves, understanding
                           that the Scots always chose their royal line on the female side, so that they
                           might keep the land for a long time afterward. And it happened in the run of
                           the years that a certain sect of the Scots departed from Ireland into Britain
                           and conquered some of that land. And their chief was called Reoda, for
                           whom they are named Dal Riata [Reoda's portion]. Sixty winters before the
                           Christ was born, Gaius Julius the Roman Emperor sought Britain with eighty
                           ships, where he was at first overwhelmed with fierce resistance and
                           misled a large portion of his army. And then he </p>
