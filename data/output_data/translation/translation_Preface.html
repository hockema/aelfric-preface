                        when there will be many dangers for mankind before the end comes. Our Lord said as
                        much to his disciples in His gospel: “Then there will be such afflictions as have
                        never been from the beginning of the world. Many false Christs will come in my name,
                        saying ‘I am Christ,’ and will do many signs and wonders to deceive mankind, as well
                        as the elect, if they can. And unless Almighty God shortens those days, all men will
                        die; yet for his elect, he will shorten those days.” 
                        <div class="lb transl line" data-tagName="lb" data-n="" data-xml-id="trans_1" data-rend="empty"><span class="transl-lineN">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class="transl-left" data-type="empty"></div>
                        </div> With God’s help, everyone may more easily withstand the coming
                        trials, if he is established in biblical doctrine; for those who continue in the
                        faith until the world end will be saved. Many trials and tribulations will come into
                        this world before the end, and they are the heralds of eternal damnation for those
                        evil men who will suffer forever in dark hell for their sinful deeds. Then the
                        Antichrist will come, who is fleshly man and true devil, just as our Savior is truly
                        man and God in one person. And then the visible devil will perform countless wonders
                        and say that he himself is God, and will seduce mankind to his heresy. Yet his time
                        will not be long, because the wrath of God will destroy him and this world will end
                        soon after. 
                        <div class="lb transl line" data-tagName="lb" data-n="" data-xml-id="trans_2" data-rend="empty"><span class="transl-lineN">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class="transl-left" data-type="empty"></div>
                        </div> Christ our Lord healed the weak
                        and sickly, and the devil who is called Antichrist (that is rightly,
                        Opposite-of-Christ) weakens and sickens those in good health, and heals no one from
                        illness except those whom he earlier corrupted himself. He and his followers corrupt
                        the bodies of men in secret through the devil’s power, and then they heal them in
                        public in the sight of men; but they cannot heal any whom God Himself afflicted.
                        Through his evilness he seduces men to turn from faith in their Maker to his
                        artifices, because he is the source of artifice and evilness. The Almighty God
                        permits the honorless Antichrist to work signs and wonders and persecution for three
                        and a half years, for in that time there will be so great evilness and crookedness
                        among mankind that they will be well-deserving of that devilish persecution, to the
                        eternal damnation of them that bow to him and to the endless joy of them who by faith
                        resist him. 
                        <div class="lb transl line" data-tagName="lb" data-n="" data-xml-id="trans_3" data-rend="empty"><span class="transl-lineN">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class="transl-left" data-type="empty"></div>
                        </div> God also permits his elect
                        servants to be cleansed from all sin through great persecution, just as gold is tried
                        by fire. The devil slays those who stand against him, and then, in holy martyrdom,
                        they go to the heavenly kingdom; he honors those who believe his lies, and they will
                        afterward have eternal torment as the reward for their heresy. The honorless one will
                        cause fire to come from above, as if from heaven in the sight of men, as if he were
                        God Almighty who has power over heaven and earth. But the Christian must then be
                        mindful of how the devil acted when he asked God that he might tempt Job: he made
                        fire come from above as if from heaven and burned up all his sheep out in the field
                        and the shepherds with them, except the one that should tell it to him. The devil
                        did
                        not send fire from heaven, though it came from above, because he himself was not in
                        heaven, not since he was cast out because of his arrogance. Neither does the cruel
                        Antichrist have the power that he might send heavenly fire, although he may appear
                        to
                        do so through the devil’s craftiness. 
                        <div class="lb transl line" data-tagName="lb" data-n="" data-xml-id="trans_4" data-rend="empty"><span class="transl-lineN">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><div class="transl-left" data-type="empty"></div>
                        </div> It
                        will be wiser now for everyone to be aware of this and know his belief, in case
                        anyone should have to endure this great misery. Our Lord commanded his disciples to
                        learn and to teach all people the things which he himself taught them; but of those
                        there are now too few who will teach it well and exemplify it well. The same Lord
                        also cried through his prophet Ezekiel: “If you do not oppose the unrighteous and
                        admonish him that he should turn from his wickedness and live, then will the wicked
                        die in his unrighteousness, and I will exact from you his blood (that is, his
                        destruction). But if you do warn the unrighteous, and he will not turn from his
                        wickedness, you will free your soul with that admonition, and the wicked will die
                        in
                        his unrighteousness.” Again, the Almighty spoke to the prophet Isaiah: “Cry out and
                        do not stop, raise your voice like a trumpet, and declare to my people their faults
                        and to the house of Jacob their sins.” With such commands in mind, we teach these
                        lessons to you, that you may ever believe in God Almighty, who crafted all creation
                        through his power, to whom be honor and glory now and forever. Amen. </p>
