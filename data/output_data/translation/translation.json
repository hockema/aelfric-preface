						"text" : "Men have need of sound instruction, even moreso at this time at the end of the world, when there will be many dangers for mankind before the end comes. Our Lord said as much to his disciples in His gospel: “Then there will be such afflictions as have never been from the beginning of the world. Many false Christs will come in my name, saying ‘I am Christ,’ and will do many signs and wonders to deceive mankind, as well as the elect, if they can. And unless Almighty God shortens those days, all men will die; yet for his elect, he will shorten those days.”      With God’s help, everyone may more easily withstand the coming trials, if he is established in biblical doctrine; for those who continue in the faith until the world end will be saved. Many trials and tribulations will come into this world before the end, and they are the heralds of eternal damnation for those evil men who will suffer forever in dark hell for their sinful deeds. Then the Antichrist will come, who is fleshly man and true devil, just as our Savior is truly man and God in one person. And then the visible devil will perform countless wonders and say that he himself is God, and will seduce mankind to his heresy. Yet his time will not be long, because the wrath of God will destroy him and this world will end soon after.      Christ our Lord healed the weak and sickly, and the devil who is called Antichrist (that is rightly, Opposite-of-Christ) weakens and sickens those in good health, and heals no one from illness except those whom he earlier corrupted himself. He and his followers corrupt the bodies of men in secret through the devil’s power, and then they heal them in public in the sight of men; but they cannot heal any whom God Himself afflicted. Through his evilness he seduces men to turn from faith in their Maker to his artifices, because he is the source of artifice and evilness. The Almighty God permits the honorless Antichrist to work signs and wonders and persecution for three and a half years, for in that time there will be so great evilness and crookedness among mankind that they will be well-deserving of that devilish persecution, to the eternal damnation of them that bow to him and to the endless joy of them who by faith resist him.      God also permits his elect servants to be cleansed from all sin through great persecution, just as gold is tried by fire. The devil slays those who stand against him, and then, in holy martyrdom, they go to the heavenly kingdom; he honors those who believe his lies, and they will afterward have eternal torment as the reward for their heresy. The honorless one will cause fire to come from above, as if from heaven in the sight of men, as if he were God Almighty who has power over heaven and earth. But the Christian must then be mindful of how the devil acted when he asked God that he might tempt Job: he made fire come from above as if from heaven and burned up all his sheep out in the field and the shepherds with them, except the one that should tell it to him. The devil did not send fire from heaven, though it came from above, because he himself was not in heaven, not since he was cast out because of his arrogance. Neither does the cruel Antichrist have the power that he might send heavenly fire, although he may appear to do so through the devil’s craftiness.      It will be wiser now for everyone to be aware of this and know his belief, in case anyone should have to endure this great misery. Our Lord commanded his disciples to learn and to teach all people the things which he himself taught them; but of those there are now too few who will teach it well and exemplify it well. The same Lord also cried through his prophet Ezekiel: “If you do not oppose the unrighteous and admonish him that he should turn from his wickedness and live, then will the wicked die in his unrighteousness, and I will exact from you his blood (that is, his destruction). But if you do warn the unrighteous, and he will not turn from his wickedness, you will free your soul with that admonition, and the wicked will die in his unrighteousness.” Again, the Almighty spoke to the prophet Isaiah: “Cry out and do not stop, raise your voice like a trumpet, and declare to my people their faults and to the house of Jacob their sins.” With such commands in mind, we teach these lessons to you, that you may ever believe in God Almighty, who crafted all creation through his power, to whom be honor and glory now and forever. Amen.",
